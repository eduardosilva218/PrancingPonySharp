# PrancingPonySharp
 Library with algorithms and data structures useful for clean project developers.
 
 ### Data Structures

### To install
The project is divided into several packages:

### More about lib
* .NETFramework 4.5 | .NETStandard 2.1
* The name was inspired by the book I love the most, _The Lord of the Rings_, and 66 was a typo that was made too late to change since I had already put it in nuget, and 6/6 is coincidentally my birthday.      
* My inspiration is to fight big problems in the huge legacy monsters I program every day.

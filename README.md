### More about lib
* Maked in .NET Framework 4.8
* The name was inspired by the book I love the most, _The Lord of the Rings_, and 66 was a typo that was made too late to change since I had already put it in nuget, and 6/6 is coincidentally my birthday.      
* My inspiration is to fight big problems in the huge legacy monsters I program every day.

# About the implementation of ToTreat in this project

The idea of structure is to force you to deal with the exceptions of your functions. Because, trusting the programmer to deal with the exceptions is dangerous and should be avoided or have you never taken an exception without treatment in your application?]

**To solve this, simply return a function or an action to the data structure it will be encapsulated.**
then, when using you will have to treat the exceptions according to what was passed.
